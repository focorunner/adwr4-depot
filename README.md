== Depot application from *Agile Web Development with Rails 4*

Following the tutorial, updating code to Rails 4.2 in a few places, adding my own
spin on how ajax is used in the shopping cart.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

* Ruby 2.2.1
* Rails 4.2.1

The author indicates that the user auth isn't complete. Anyone could create a new
user for example and have admin privileges.  I'd combine the store components of this 
application with a better user auth, either a devise-based, or using a more comprehensive
approach like that in "The Rails Tutorial" by Hartl.
